When add a new devices you must create new code at 
    1. dataAccess.js = How to get product data
    2. normalizeData.js = How to reformat data
    3. autorun.js = Save data from dataAccess.js to mongo
    4. db.js = devices service
    5. token.js = Get user permission at first time

Algorithm at autorun should be fixed, because it use polling method.
